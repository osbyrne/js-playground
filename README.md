### I am trying to solve a math problem, here it goes:

you get a set of integers from 1 to n
- how many subsets can you create?
- what are all the possible subsets of all possible lengths of the main set?
- how many of these subsets's sums is divisible by an integer k?

Then, I'll try to:
- generalise a solution to any set of integers, 
- build a webapp around it to test in the browser
- optimise memory usage and runtime by paralelisation of tasks
